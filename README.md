## Abstract

The objective of this study is to refine the analytical process of gait assessment by leveraging computational models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN). These models aim to introduce data-driven methods for evaluating gait patterns, enabling early detection and intervention of abnormal gait patterns that may indicate musculoskeletal or neurological impairments. By automating gait data analysis using SVM and k-NN classifiers, we facilitate early diagnosis and tailored rehabilitation strategies, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

## Introduction

Walking is a complex human activity involving the coordination of physiological systems such as the brain, nerves, and muscles. Gait analysis has traditionally been subjective, relying on expert judgment. However, advances in AI have transformed gait analysis into a more objective and data-driven field. This study focuses on using SVM and k-NN classifiers to analyze gait data, enabling precise measurement of gait parameters and early detection of abnormalities.

## Methodology

This study utilized SVM and k-NN classifiers to analyze gait data collected from 21 healthy subjects walking on a split-belt treadmill at various speeds. Data were collected using an infrared cinematography system coupled with force plates, capturing 3D motion and ground reaction forces. The collected data underwent preprocessing, including noise removal and normalization, followed by feature extraction. SVM and k-NN models were trained and evaluated on this data to classify normal and abnormal gait patterns.

## Results and Discussion

The KNN model achieved an accuracy of 98.92%, outperforming the SVM model, which had an accuracy of 90.05%. The results indicate that KNN was better at learning the underlying patterns in the dataset. The study emphasizes the importance of considering other factors such as class distribution, feature relevance, and model complexity in addition to accuracy.

## Conclusion

This research demonstrates the effectiveness of using SVM and k-NN classifiers for real-time gait disorder analysis. The high accuracy achieved by the KNN model highlights its potential for early detection of gait abnormalities, paving the way for timely interventions and improved patient outcomes.
